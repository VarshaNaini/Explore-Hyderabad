    <h2>10.Vidyaranya High School,Madhapur</h2>
    <p>Vidyaranya was started with the objective of making school a happy place, and learning, a happy experience. Learning is a natural process and happens best when the learner is eager to learn. It comes about in an atmosphere of love, good relationship and friendliness and only when both the teacher and the taught have open and receptive minds. Learning based on fear and coercion is not real learning and respect extracted through such fear, again, is not real respect at all. Fear and other inhibitions as well as authoritarian attitudes build walls of resistance between students and teachers.
